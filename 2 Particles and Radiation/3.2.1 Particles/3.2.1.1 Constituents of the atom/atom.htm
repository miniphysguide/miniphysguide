<h2>
CONSTITUENTS OF THE ATOM
</h2>
<br>

<p>
This page explains what a simple atom model consists of. It also goes over specific charge and explains what isotopes are and how they can be useful.


</p>
<br>
<h3>
Simple model of the atom
</h3>


<p>
The atom is made up of 3 parts: protons, neutrons and electrons.
<br><br>
The protons and neutrons make up the 'nucleus' at the centre of the atom, and the electrons orbit the nucleus in 'shells'.

<div class="note">
<hr style="width">
<p style="margin:2px 0px 2px 0px"><b>Note 1:  </b>
The nucleus is the dense positively charged central core of an atom, it contains nearly all of its mass.
</p>
<hr>
</div>


<div class="note">
<hr style="width">
<p style="margin:2px 0px 2px 0px"><b>Note 2:  </b>
Shells represent different sets of orbitals around the nucleus that are able to hold electrons of similar energies.
<br><br>
You don't need to learn about orbitals in AQA A level physics but if you're interested, chemguide explains it well 
<a href="https://www.chemguide.co.uk/atoms/properties/atomorbs.html">here</a>.
</p>

<br>
This is an example of what the simple atomic model looks like. Note that these 'models' are used to convey concepts and this doesn't necessarily convey what an actual atom looks like.


<br><br>
Each constituent (part) has its own charge and mass which can be described in two ways: in SI units, and as relative units.
<br><br>

 Relative units convey the same information as SI units but in terms of a 
different number so you can compare the three particles more easily.
<br><br>
 Here, the relative charges are just the charges expressed in terms of 
1.6 &times; 10 <sup>-19</sup> C - the charge of a proton (this means that the number 1 in relative terms would equal 1.6 &times; 10 <sup>-19</sup> C).
<br><br>
Similarly, the relative masses are just the masses expressed in terms of the atomic mass unit (amu), which is equal to <sup>1</sup> &frasl; <sub>12</sub> th of the mass of an atom of carbon-12. This is about 1.67 &times; 10 <sup>-27</sup>.
<br><br> All relative atomic masses in the periodic table are due to comparison with the amu.

<hr style="width">
<p style="margin:2px 0px 2px 0px"><b>Note:  </b>
You will need to know the relative charges and masses off by heart.

<h3>
Specific charge
</h3>

<p>

The specific charge of a particle shows its charge to mass ratio. It is a named property because it can be commonly used or recognised so giving it a name makes describing things or patterns easier ( I suppose that's why we give *anything* names, though).


<br><br>
Specific Charge (Ckg<sup>-1</sup>) = <sup>Charge (C)</sup> &frasl; <sub>Mass (kg)</sub>

<div class="warning">
<hr style="width">
<p style="margin:2px 0px 2px 0px"><b>Important:  </b> 
Specific charge compares the SI charges and masses, NOT the relative ones (this means that the charge and mass in your calculation should be really tiny values).
</p>
<hr>
</div>



<div class="note">
<hr style="width">
<p style="margin:2px 0px 2px 0px"><b>Note:  </b>
I'm not sure why seemingly all revision resources and textbooks describe specific charge as a ratio because although it is correct (shows the ratio when the mass is 1 kg), that can be said with anything calculated by one division but usually you would describe that quantity as x per unit y- in this case, charge per unit mass. It's like describing speed as a distance to time ratio rather than distance per unit time.
</p>
<hr>
</div>

You may be asked to work out the specific charge of something. As long as you remember Charge (C) over Mass (kg), you should be fine.

<br>
<p class="eg">
e.g. <b>Work out the specific charge of an electron:</b>

<br><br>
Charge (C) = - 1.60 &times; 10 <sup>-19</sup> C
<br>
Mass (kg) = 9.11 &times; 10 <sup>-31</sup> kg

<br><br>
Specific Charge (Ckg<sup>-1</sup>) = <sup>Charge (C)</sup> &frasl; <sub>Mass (kg)</sub>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 &thinsp; &thinsp;  &thinsp; 
&hairsp;&hairsp; 
= <sup>- 1.60 &times; 10 <sup>-19</sup></sup> &frasl; <sub>9.11 &times; 10 <sup>-31</sup></sub>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 &thinsp; &thinsp;  &thinsp; 
&hairsp;&hairsp; 
= 1.7563117... &times; 10 <sup>11</sup> Ckg<sup>-1</sup>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 &thinsp; &thinsp;  &thinsp; 
&hairsp;&hairsp; 
&asymp; 1.76 &times; 10 <sup>11</sup> Ckg<sup>-1</sup>

</p>

<h3>
Nuclide notation
</h3>

<p>
Any atom can be represented by the nuclide notation, which is used in the periodic table and looks like this:



<img 
  src="Nuclide notation.png" 
  alt="Illustration of the nuclide notation."
  display="block"/>




<div class="note">
<hr style="width">
<p style="margin:2px 0px 2px 0px"><b>Note:  </b>
Both protons and neutrons are nuclides because they make up the nucleus.
<br><br>
The periodic table will not always have whole number values for
 the nucleon number. This is because the value stated will be a mean of all of the differently weighted atoms of that element (taking abundance of different isotopes, which will be explored soon, into account).
</p>
<hr>
</div>
Proton number is also called the atomic number, this is just the number of protons. 
<br><br>Nucleon number is also called the relative atomic mass (sometimes confusingly just called atomic mass). 
<br>In reality, these two are not the same thing due to the atomic mass unit (amu) being a fixed number to compare to for the RAM and the masses of a proton and a neutron actually differing slightly. 
Although the difference between nucleon number and RAM is usually not significant enough to change the number that much so we can treat it as the same for simpler things like this.
<br><br>The periodic table uses the average relative atomic mass of all the atoms for each element.
<div class="note">
<hr style="width">
<p style="margin:2px 0px 2px 0px"><b>Note:  </b>
Nucleon number and proton number can always be notated by A and Z respectively.
</p>
<hr>
</div>


</p>

<br>

<h3>
Isotopes
</h3>

<h4>
What are isotopes?
</h4>
<p>

<div style="background-color:#fff0cc; text-align:center; padding:2%; border-style: dashed; border-color: #ffc536;">
Isotopes are atoms with the same number of protons but a different number of neutrons.
</div>
<br>
For example, hydrogen has 3 naturally occurring isotopes: 
<ul>
  <li><sup>1</sup>H, hydrogen-1 (also called protium)</li>
  <li><sup>2</sup>H, hydrogen-2 (also called deuterium)</li>
  <li>and <sup>3</sup>H, hydrogen-3 (also called tritium)</li>
</ul>


<div class="note">
<hr style="width">
<p style="margin:2px 0px 2px 0px"><b>Note:  </b>
Notice that here, the nuclide notation only provides the relative atomic mass and element symbol. This is just a simpler way of using the notation because the type of
 element provides information on the atomic number already so 
essentially this displays the same information (as long as you have a periodic table handy to figure out how many protons (the atomic number) that element has).
<br><br>
The name where its the element name (or symbol) followed with a hyphen and its mass number written after it is called 'hyphen notation'. You don't need to know what it's called but it's quite useful when talking about isotopes. <sup>1</sup>H = hydrogen-1 = H-1

</p>
<hr>
</div>


We know that, since they are all hydrogen, they all have one proton (and one electron because atoms are neutrally charged) each. The difference in RAM is due to a change in the no. of neutrons. 
<br><br>From this, looking back on these isotopes of hydrogen, we know that where A=1, hydrogen has 0 neutrons; where A=2, H has 1 neutron; and where A=3, H has 2 neutrons.

<br><br><br>

A more practical example is <b>carbon-14</b> which is a radioactive isotope of carbon. It can be used to approximate the age of a given object containing organic material via <b>carbon dating</b>.
<br><br>Since the atomic number of carbon is 6, we can work out that this isotope has 6 protons (and 6 electrons) and 8 (14 protons and neutrons minus number of protons) neutrons.
<h5>
Carbon dating
</h5>
<sup>14</sup>C is created in the upper atmosphere due to the reaction of neutrons (produced by cosmic rays) and <sup>14</sup>N atoms.
<br><br>This is then oxidised, forming <sup>14</sup>CO<sub>2</sub> which is dispersed through the atmosphere and mixed with <sup>12</sup>CO<sub>2</sub>
 and <sup>13</sup>CO<sub>2</sub>.

<br><br> This CO<sub>2</sub> is then used in the photosynthesis of plants
 and gradually passed down the food chain to living animals and plants. 
This means that ALL participants of this chain will have the same amount of
 <sup>14</sup>C compared to <sup>12</sup>C as the atmosphere does
 (the <sup>14</sup>C:<sup>12</sup>C ratio).

<br><br>
The basic concept of carbon dating is to compare the <sup>14</sup>C:<sup>12</sup>C ratio now to the ratio when the object was alive. The tissue is no longer being replaced if the living thing is dead so the radioactive decay of <sup>14</sup>C becomes apparent so we can use the half life of <sup>14</sup>C to find an estimate for how long the object has been dead.

  <li>Specific charge is actual charge in coulombs over actual mass in kg.</li>
  <li> A= relative atomic mass, Z= atomic number.</li>
  <li>Isotopes are atoms with the same no of protons (so of the same element) and dif. number of neutrons</li>
  <li>Isotopic data can be used in archeological analysis. <br>For example, <sup>14</sup>C is used in carbon dating to fins the age of organic specimens.</li>
