<h2>
STABLE AND UNSTABLE NUCLEI
</h2>
<br>

<p>
This page introduces the strong nuclear force, including its role and range.
 Explains why some nuclei are unstable and how they become more stable via alpha decay or beta-minus decay.

</p>
<br>
<h3>
The strong nuclear force (SNF)
</h3>

<p>
The nucleus of an atom consists of a densely packed ball of protons and neutrons, however this shouldn't make much sense because of the repulsion between the positively charged protons... how on earth does the nucleus hold together? That's the role of the strong nuclear force- it only acts on the nucleons to counteract this electrostatic force of repulsion between the protons to hold the nucleus together.
<br><br>
The SNF is capable of both attraction and repulsion and does so at different ranges- this is because if it was solely an attractive force counteracting the electrostatic repulsion between the protons, there's nothing stopping the nucleus to collapse on itself under the pressure and squishing down to an infinitesimal point. The strong nuclear force has a very short range to begin with, but by this logic the range of the repulsive force is even shorter.
<br><br>
...which is true because the strong nuclear force has a short range of 3 fm and is repulsive at distances < 0.5 fm. This is shown in the following graph, which you need o be able to replicate.

but has an extremely short range.

<h3>Unstable Nuclei</h3>

<p>
Since the SNF acts based on no. of nucleons and the electrostatic force acts based on the no. of protons only (in the case of the nucleus), a sort of balance needs to be kept to ensure the nucleus is not going to fall apart and is stable. 
<br><br>
For example, if there were way too many protons, the electrostatic force would be disproportionally larger than is expected for that size nucleus and vice versa for if there were too many neutrons (or too little protons depending on how you look at it) but for the same size nucleus, no mater what the nucleons are, the strength of the SNF remains pretty much the same.
<br><br>
This means that for each size of nucleus, there is an ideal (or most stable) ratio of protons to neutrons, although this ratio differs with size. This ideal ratio concept can be displayed by a 'line of stability':
<br><br>

topic, I just thought it was nice to use it here too.
</p>
<hr>
</div>

The nuclei that fit this line are the most stable for that size nucleus, so ones that are far from the line are unstable and will decay (emit radiation) to change its nucleon composition to become more stable.
<br><br>
Keep in mind though that the nuclei on the line of stability are not equally stable. Iron (Fe) is the most stable element and nuclei smaller or larger than it on that line will be more and more unstable- this is a factor in why alpha decay occurs so much.

<div class="note">
<hr style="width">
<p style="margin:2px 0px 2px 0px"><b>Note:  </b>
A large cause of the variation of stability along the line of stability is due to

<h4>
Alpha decay
</h4>

Alpha decay occurs in large nuclei with too many of both protons and neutrons. It involves the release of an alpha particle (a He nucleus) which consists of 2 protons and 2 neutrons, so the atom loses those 2 protons and 2 neutrons.

Here's the general equation:
