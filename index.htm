welcome to  mini physguide! :)

<p>
This is very much inspired by chemguide and mainly 
just a small project for myself to try provide as much help
 as I can for studying the AQA A level Physics course.

       (Option D) Turning Points in Physics </a></td>
    <td>Experiments and monumentous moments in the history of physics! How theories came about and were disproven and evolved: specific charge of the electron (cathode rays, thermionic emission, the fine beam tube, 
and Thomson's crossed fields); Millikan's oil drop experiment where he used Stoke's law (viscous drag force) and knowledge of gravity and the electric force on a charged particle in an 
electric field to discover that charge is quantised and work out the fundamental charge (the charge of an electron); the battle between if light was a wave or a particle through how Newton's corpuscular theory 
took years to be disproven and the development of Huygen's wave theory with the help of Young's double slit experiment and the discovery of Maxwell's
 predicted EM waves thanks to Hertz's sparks and Fizeau's cogs; the photoelectric effect and the photon model, revisiting the general idea and delving into the original predictions using classical physics and how that caused the 'ultraviolet catastrophe' 
and how Planck's 'quanta' interpretation of EM waves developed into Einstein's photon model of light which was able to explain this phenomena; the concept of wave-particle duality being introduced by De Broglie 
and how electron diffraction supported this, it also explains to us why electron microscopes work at such high resolutions, the speed of light and relativity where the Michelson-Morley 
experiment disproved the idea of absolute motion and ether using an interferometer, 
and finally how things that are moving at relativistic speeds (close to the speed of light) experience some very strange effects, how Einstein has tried to explain this with
 his theory of special relativity (inertial frames, time dilation, muon decay, length contraction, relativistic mass and energy) and how Bertozzi provided experimental 
evidence for the increase in mass of objects with speed.
