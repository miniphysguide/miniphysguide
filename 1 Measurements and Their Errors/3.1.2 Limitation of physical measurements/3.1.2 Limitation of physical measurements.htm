<h2>
LIMITATION OF PHYSICAL MEASUREMENTS
</h2>
<br>

<p>
This page introduces random and systematic errors and gives definitions for the common terms
 precision, accuracy, repeatability, reproducibility, resolution, reading, and
measurement. It will also go over absolute, fractional, and percentage uncertainties and how to calculate with them, as well as how 
uncertainty is displayed and calculated in graphs.

</p>
<br>
<h3>
A few key terms explained
</h3>

<h4>
Precision vs accuracy
</h4>

<p>
These two terms are often confused for each other, although their difference should be quite clear with the help of visuals.

<br><br>
<b>Precision</b> can only be used to describe a set of <i>multiple readings</i> because
 it compares <i>how close together</i> your results are and has nothing to do the actual value or other people's experiments.
 <br><br>The more precise your results, the less they differ from each other.
<br><br>

<b>Accuracy</b> is used to describe how close the mean of your results/your measurement is to the <i>true value</i>.
<br><br>The more accurate your results, the closer they are to the actual true value.
<br><br> Low precision describes a problem of dispersion (variation) whereas low accuracy describes a problem of mean (centering).

<br><br>
I think this target representation is a really neat way of visualising this:
<br>
</p>

  <img 
    style="width:480px"
    src="targets.png" 
    alt="Illustration of accuracy vs. precision using a shooting target."

<p

         color: grey;
         font-size: 80%;
         margin:4px 0px 10px 0px;">
With this, we imagine the centre of the target being the true value of what we're measuring (what the measurement should be if it was 100% accurate), and the dots being our individual measurements.

</p>

<p>
In terms of actual measurements, here's an example of the same 4 situations when trying to measure the mass of a 100g mass:

<b>Not Accurate, Not Precise</b>
</p>
</p>

<br><br><br>
<br>


<p> I also quite like this representation using a distribution graph (the graphs with the blue line):
 <img 
    style="width:480px"
    src="distribution.png" 
    alt="Illustration of accuracy vs. precision using a distribution graph."
    display="block"/>
</p>

<div class="note">
<hr style="width">
<p style="margin:2px 0px 2px 0px"><b>Note:  </b>
If you're unfamilliar with distribution graphs, the x-axis represents number values of what a reading is- in this case, the true value of what is being measured is represented by the
the dotted line so the x-value at the dotted line is the true value. The y-axis is represents how many results there are that are a given x-value (or the proportion of total results with that value).
 This means that in these graphs, the peaks represent the mean of the results (as well as the mode) because the peak is at the centre of each distribution. where the peak is not equal to the true value is where there is inaccuracy. 
The width of the distribution shows how spread out the results are from each other, so the wider the graph, the less precise the results are since they are less consistent (more varied).
</p>
<hr>
</div>


<br>
<h4>
Repeatability vs reproducibility
</h4>

<p>
These two words are both used to describe how consistent results are if the experiment is done again, so are ways of measuring precision.

<br><br> If results have high repeatability and reproducibility,
 we tend to view them as more reliable, it demonstrates that these findings are not expected to change over time. 



<div class="note">
<hr style="width">
<p style="margin:2px 0px 2px 0px"><b>Note:  </b>
Often in scientific write ups, 
repeatability and reproducibility are expressed as standard deviations
 (a measure of how much results vary).
</p>
<hr>
</div>

<br>
<b>Repeatability</b> measures the variation of results when the same experiment is done again with the same setup and location, observer, and conditions over a short amount of time. You can view it as measuring the precision of one set of results for an experiment by doing repeats.

<br><br>
<b>Reproducibility</b> measures the variation of results too, but more the variation between different times the experiment has been replicated by different people at different locations with different instruments and perhaps different methods.
It measures our ability to replicate the findings of others.
<br><br>
I like to view it as repeatability measuring the variation of results for one scientist at their own lab doing their experiment and reproducibility measuring
 the variation of results for the whole world collectively trying this same experiment in their separate labs.

 <img 
    style="width:400px"
    src="Rep rep drawing.png" 
    alt="Drawing of repeatability and reproducibility."
    display="block"/>

</p>

<h4>
Resolution
</h4>


<b> Resolution</b> describes the smallest change in quantity being measured that clearly gives a change in reading is for a given instrument.
<br> <br>
For example, let's say we had a mass balance and the reading was 0.00g, then we slowly added teeny sprinkles of flour until the reading changed. 
If the reading changed to 0.01g, then we can say the mass balance has a resolution of 0.01g. On the other hand, if the first reading it changed to was instead 0.05g (so it can only round the quantity to 0.00g, 0.05g, 0.10g, 0.15g etc), 
it would have a resolution of 0.05g. 
<br><br>
<div class="note">
<hr style="width">
<p style="margin:2px 0px 2px 0px"><b>Note:  </b>

This value of resolution in measuring instruments seems to contradict how we'd normally describe instruments with resolution.

<br><br> 
When comparing the mass balances in the previous example, you'd normally intuitively say that the 0.01g res. mass balance has a higher resolution than the 0.05g res. mass balance because it can be seen as being a 'higher quality' mass balance.
<br><br>

This is more obviously seen when describing photos- higher quality photos are described as having a higher resolution even though the 
value of the resolution is expected to be smaller. This comparison makes a lot more sense in pictures when you realise that resolution in images
 is usually measured in ppm (pixels per metre) rather than an actual length which makes the description completely more logical.

<br><br>
This is kind of applied to all resolutions: although we sometimes state resolution as just a length, when comparing, it's always in measures per unit (even though we sometimes don't realise we're doing that).
<br><br>
From knowing this, it makes perfect sense how the mass balance with the resolution of 0.01g has a higher resolution than the mass balance with a resolution of 0.05g, even though it seems absurd!
 
</p>
<hr>
</div>




<h4>
Reading vs measurement
</h4>

<p>
We generally throw these two terms around interchangably but they are different from each other.

<br><br>
Readings are where one value is taken (e.g. reading a thermometer), whereas measurements are where the difference
 between two readings is found (e.g. measuring with a ruler- both the start and end point have to be judged).

<br><br>
Understanding this difference is important for determining uncertainty.

<h3>
Random and systematic errors
</h3>

<h4>
What are random errors?
</h4>

<p>
Errors caused by unpredictable changes/events during an experiment are random errors (not surprisingly). 
<br><br>
These errors affect <b>precision</b>, meaning they 
cause differences in the measurements/readings leading to the results being spread about the mean.
<br><br>
You <b>cannot</b> eliminate all random errors.
<br><br>
For example, a random error could be electronic noise in an electrical circuit; or perhaps changes in air currents/wind when measuring with a mass balance- they are usually things out of your control.
<br><br>
Human error and environmental error are usually kinds of random error.

</p>


<h4>
How to reduce random error
</h4>

<p>
There are arguably infinite ways of reducing random errors, here's a few examples:

<ul>
  <li>Take at least 3 <b> repeats</b> and calculate a <b>mean</b>, identifying and ignoring any anomalies.</li>
  <br><li>Reduce human error by using <b>computers</b>, <b>data loggers</b>, or<b> cameras</b> for measurements.</li>
  <br><li>Control <b>environmental factors</b> as best as you can (do the experiment in a short amount of time to reduce temperature variation, or close the windows to reduce change in air currents etc.)</li>
</ul>  

</p>
<br>
<h4>
What are systematic errors?
</h4>

<p>
Errors that cause a consistent, repeatable difference in measurement due to apparatus or flawed 
experimental design.
<br><br>
Systematic errors affect <b>accuracy</b>, meaning they cause the reading to be off (too high or too low) by the same amount.
<br><br>
Since the error is consistent, it's easier to work around systematic errors (for example,
 if you find that a mass balance wasn't zeroed properly and instead reads 0.25g when nothing's on it, you can just subtract 0.25g from 
the readings you've taken with the uncalibrated balance).
<br><br>
Another example of a systematic error is if you are working with a faulty instrument. This may cause you to have a scale factor error but
 at A level, generally when talking about systematic errors, it refers to offset errors due to calibration problems.
<br><br>
<b>Zero errors</b> are the most common type of systematic error (where an instrument, like a mass balance, is not zeroed properly).
</p>

<h4>
Reducing systematic error
</h4>
<p>
It's more difficult to detect systematic errors but there are ways to reduce them beforehand:


<ul>
  <li><b>Calibrate</b> the apparatus and check it by measuring a known value to easily identify a systematic error (e.g. weigh a 1 kg mass on a mass balance).</li>
  <br><li>During radiation experiments, take counts for 
<b>background radiation</b> beforehand to correct the final results by excluding those counts.</li>
  <br><li>Repeat the experiment with <b>different instruments</b> to check that they match (this is different to finding a mean).</li>
</ul>  

</p>

<br>
<h4>
Parallax error
</h4>


<p>
Where the reading is affected by the angle of which it is read,
 parallax error can occur if the reading isn't read at eye level.
<br><br>
For example, when measuring the amount of a liquid using a measuring cylinder, you read from the bottom of the meniscus.
If you are not at eye level with the meniscus, the reading is affected.

<div class="note">
<hr style="width">
<p style="margin:2px 0px 2px 0px"><b>Note:  </b>
The meniscus refers to the curved upper surface of a liquid in a tube, although it has other meanings too!
</p>
<hr>
</div>

A parallax error could be an example of a random error due to the angle 
at which the reading is taken from being inconsistent.
<br><br>
It could perhaps instead be a systematic error if the person 
takes the reading at a consistently wrong (not eye level) angle as the results are off by the same amount.
<br><br>
What a wild child.
</p>

<br><br>
<h3>
Uncertainty
</h3>

<p>
The uncertainty of a measurement is the boundary which we expect the true value to lie in.
<br><br>
 For example, if given a value of 30 &plusmn; 5 &deg;C, 
we can expect the true value to be between 25 &deg;C and 35 &deg;C.
<br><br>
Uncertainty is rounded to the same level of refinement
 as the measurement/reading (round to last s.f. of measurement/reading e.g. 9.5 &plusmn; 0.3 kg) - unless it's a fraction, of course.
<br><br>
There are different ways of expressing uncertainty:
<br><br>
<b>Absolute uncertainty</b>: &hairsp;&hairsp;&hairsp;&hairsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 uncertainty given as a fixed quantity.
<p class="eg"> &hairsp;&hairsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 e.g. 27.0<b> &plusmn; 0.9</b> A</p> 

<b>Fractional uncertainty</b>: &hairsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;uncertainty given as a fraction of the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 measurement/reading.
<p class="eg"> &hairsp;&hairsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 e.g. 27.0<b> &plusmn; <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>30</sub></b> A</p> 

<b>Percentage uncertainty</b>:&nbsp;&nbsp; uncertainty given as a percentage of the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 measurement/reading.
<p class="eg"> &hairsp;&hairsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 e.g. 27.0<b> &plusmn; 3.3 %</b> A</p> 


You can reduce percentage and fractional uncertainty by taking 
larger measurements/readings due to the absolute uncertainty remaining the same.

</p>

<h4>
Calculating with uncertainty
</h4>


<p>
If values are <b>added/subtracted</b>, we add the <b>absolute</b> uncertainties.
<p class="eg">
For example, (12.0 <b>&plusmn; 0.5</b>) - (3.9 <b>&plusmn; 0.8</b>) = (8.1 <b>&plusmn; 1.3</b>). 
<br><br>
If you think
 about it, this makes sense, if two values have uncertainty, combining them creates a larger uncertainty. 
<br><br>
The lowest possible value would be when the values are
 (12.0 - 0.5) - (3.9 + 0.8) = (8.1 - 0.8) or 11.5 - 4.7 = 7.3. 
<br><br>
The highest possible value would be 
(12.0 + 0.5) - (3.9 - 0.8) = (8.1 + 0.8) or 12.5 - 3.1 = 8.9.
<br><br>
 The absolute uncertainties are added when 
values are added or subtracted.
</p>

<br>
If values are <b>multiplied/divided</b>, we add the <b>percentage</b> (or fractional) uncertainties.
<p class="eg">
For example, if we were to times the values from the previous example instead, we need to convert to percentage uncertainty:
<br><br>
(12.0 <b>&plusmn; 0.5</b>) &times; (3.9 <b>&plusmn; 0.8</b>) 
= (12.0 <b>&plusmn; 4.2 %</b>) &times; (3.9 <b>&plusmn; 20.5 %</b>)

<br><br>
Then just perform the calculation and add the percentage uncertainties
<br><br>
&nbsp; &hairsp;&hairsp;&hairsp;&nbsp; &thinsp; &hairsp;&nbsp; &thinsp; &hairsp;&nbsp; &thinsp; &hairsp;&nbsp; &thinsp; &hairsp;&nbsp; &thinsp; &hairsp;&nbsp; &thinsp; &hairsp;&nbsp; &thinsp; &hairsp;&nbsp; &thinsp; &hairsp;&nbsp; &thinsp; &hairsp;
= (12.0 &times; 3.9) <b>&plusmn; (4.2 + 20.5) %</b>
<br>
&nbsp; &hairsp;&hairsp;&hairsp;&nbsp; &thinsp; &hairsp;&nbsp; &thinsp; &hairsp;&nbsp; &thinsp; &hairsp;&nbsp; &thinsp; &hairsp;&nbsp; &thinsp; &hairsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &thinsp; &hairsp;&nbsp; &thinsp; &hairsp;&thinsp; &hairsp;&nbsp; &thinsp; &hairsp;
= 46.8 <b>&plusmn; 24.7 %</b>

<br><br>
You can convert this back to absolute uncertainty if you'd like:
<br><br>
&nbsp; &hairsp;&hairsp;&hairsp;&nbsp; &thinsp; &hairsp;&nbsp; &thinsp; &hairsp;&nbsp; &thinsp; &hairsp;&nbsp; &thinsp; &hairsp;&nbsp; &thinsp; &hairsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &thinsp; &hairsp;&nbsp; &thinsp; &hairsp;&thinsp; &hairsp;&nbsp; &thinsp; &hairsp;
= 46.8 <b>&plusmn; 11.6</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>

Remember that raising to a power is the same as timesing by itself that many times 
(e.g. q<sup>3</sup> = q &times; q &times; q so if q had an uncertainty, the % uncertainty of 
q<sup>3</sup> would be 3 times the % uncertainty of q using multiplication rules).
</p>






<div class="note">
<hr style="width">

<p style="margin:2px 0px 2px 0px"><b>Extra note:  </b> 
Thinking about adding the percentage uncertainties when 
doing multiplication/division, there isn't a clear reason why this is the case.
This is because rather than being the 'true range of uncertainty', doing this is more of an
 approximation because it's very accurate most of the time and using the real value doesn't normally make much of
 a difference. If you're interested in seeing why, I explain it

<h4>
Resolution and uncertainty
</h4>

<p>
Refresh yourself on the difference between readings and measurements (for readings, you take one value; for measurements, you determine the difference between two readings).

<br><br>
The uncertainty in a <i>reading</i> is<b> &plusmn; half of the smallest division/interval</b>.
<p class="eg">e.g. for a thermometer the smallest division is 1°C so the uncertainty is ±0.5°C. <p>

    src="Resolutionthermometerreadinguncertainty.png" 
    alt="Illustration of thermometer uncertainty calculation."
    display="block"/>



<br><br>
The uncertainty in a <i>measurement</i> is<b> &plusmn; the smallest division/interval</b>.
<p class="eg">e.g. for a ruler, you must account for both the start and end readings, the smallest division is 1 mm so the uncertainty of each of the readings
 is 0.5 mm. this means the total absolute uncertainty of the measurement is 0.5 mm + 0.5 mm = 1 mm. <p>

<br><br>
 For <b>digital data</b>, the uncertainty of the instrument (and therefore the data taken from it) is assumed to be
 <b>&plusmn; 1 of the smallest division/interval</b> (or the last significant digit 
e.g. 2.76  &plusmn; 0.01 &ohm;) if the uncertainty isn't quoted already. 

<br><br>
This is the same for given values.


<div class="note">
<hr style="width">
<p style="margin:2px 0px 2px 0px"><b>Note:  </b>
Although for given values, usually they are averages of various measurements so in practice, the actual uncertainty would be much greater.
</p>
<hr>
</div>


<br><br>
This means that the resolution of the instrument affects its uncertainty.

<br><br><br>
<b>Repeated data</b> has an absolute uncertainty that is half of the range (largest value - smallest value).
 <br><br>This is written as <b>the mean &plusmn; <sup>range</sup> &frasl; <sub>2</sub></b>:
<br><br>
For example, here's how the data for how long it takes for people to run 100 m could be represented and organised:
<br><br>
<table>
  <tr>
    <th rowspan="2">Name</th>
    <th colspan="6">Time taken (s)</th>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <th>1</th>
    <th>2</th>
    <th>3</th>
    <th>mean</th>
    <th>range</th>
    <th>uncertainty</th>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Bobby</td>
    <td>13.6</td>
    <td>13.1</td>
    <td>13.2</td>
    <td>13.3</td>
    <td>0.5</td>
    <td>&plusmn; 0.3</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Marcus</td>
    <td>13.8</td>
    <td>13.8</td>
    <td>13.8</td>
    <td>13.8</td>
    <td>0.0</td>
    <td>&plusmn; 0.1</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Tristan</td>
    <td>12.4</td>
    <td>12.6</td>
    <td>11.7</td>
    <td>12.2</td>
    <td>0.9</td>
    <td>&plusmn; 0.5</td>
  </tr>

</table>

<div class="note">
<hr style="width">
<p style="margin:2px 0px 2px 0px"><b>Note:  </b>
Remember that the uncertainty (and the mean) has to be to the same last significant figure as the
 data. Also that the uncertainty has to be *at least* &plusmn; the last significant digit due to the resolution of the instrument.
</p>
<hr>
</div>


</p>

<h4>Reducing uncertainty</h4>

<p>
You can reduce absolute uncertainty by using <b>higher resolution instruments</b>, or using computers and sensors for multiple readings.
<br><br>
You could also measure over <b>multiple instances</b>- for example, to
 measure the time taken for one swing of a pendulum, if the time taken for 10 swings is 7.3 &plusmn; 0.1 s, then the time for one swing would be 0.73 &plusmn; 0.01 s which is 
a lower uncertainty than if you were to time one swing directly (0.7 &plusmn; 0.1 s) 
<br> <br>
Another method could be fixing one end of a ruler so that you are taking the uncertainty for a reading rather than a measurement (e.g. when measuring the extension of a spring, instead of using the ruler freehand each time, tape it to the clamp so you only need to line up the bottom reading).
<br><br>

Reducing percentage uncertainty is even simpler because it's dependent on how large the data is. 
For example, you can see that 0.25 &plusmn; 0.01 g has a higher % uncertainty than 2.78 &plusmn; 0.01g.
<br><br>If you keep the absolute uncertainty
 the same using the same method then you could just scale up whatever you're measuring (depending on if that'd affect the experiment).
</p>


<h4>Graph uncertainty </h4>
<h5>Error bars</h5>

<p>
Uncertainties on graphs are shown as error bars. They visually represent the range quite well and look like this:
<br><br>
<img 
    style="width:70%; float:left;"
    src="Error area.png" 
    alt="Drawing of a labelled error bar."
    display="block"/>

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
A line of best fit should go through all error bars (excluding anomolous points):
<br><br>
<img 
    style="width:100%; float:left;"
    src="Lineofbestfit.png" 
    alt="Graph showing line of best fit."
    display="block"/>
<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><brbr><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>


<h5>Uncertainty in the gradient</h5>

The absolute uncertainty in the gradient can be found by drawing the
 steepest and shallowest 'lines of worst fit' (still going through <i>all</i> error bars)
 and finding the <b>difference between these two gradients</b>.
<br><br>
<img 
    style="width:100%; float:left;"
    src="Lines (1).png" 
    alt="graph showing lines of worst fit."
    display="block"/>

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><brbr><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

If the line of best fit had a gradient of -3.0 and the lines of worst fit had gradients -2.7 and -3.4, then you would write the final 
gradient as -3.0 &plusmn; 0.7. 

<div class="note">
<hr style="width">
<p style="margin:2px 0px 2px 0px"><b>Note:  </b>
Just like with any other uncertainty, this can be converted to percentage uncertainty if you want.
</p>
<hr>
</div>

<br>
This is just an example- since the graphs drawn have no scale on the axes, the gradients could be anything!


<div class="note">
<hr style="width">
<p style="margin:2px 0px 2px 0px"><b>Note:  </b>
Axes is the plural of axis and is pronounced "axe-ease".
</p>
<hr>
</div>


<div class="note">
<hr style="width">
<p style="margin:2px 0px 2px 0px"><b>Note:  </b>
You need to be confident with calculating gradients. 
<br><br>
The gradient gives a measure for how steep a slope is. 
<br>It is calculated by doing <sup> change in y </sup> &frasl; <sub> change in x </sub> for a straight line graph.
</p>
<hr>
</div>



<h5>Uncertainty in the y-intercept</h5>

If the two lines of worst fit give different y-intercepts, you can do the same kind of calculation as you did for the gradient to give an uncertainty for the y- intercept.
<br><br>
The absolute uncertainty will be the difference in the y-intercepts of the lines of worst fit.
<br><br>
If the y-intercept from the line of best fit was 7.9 and the y-intercepts of the lines of worst fit were 7.0 and 8.5, then
 you can write the reading of the y-intercept as 7.9 &plusmn; 1.5.
</p>
<br><br>

<h4> A final summary </h4>

<p>
<ul>
  <li>We now know what some important words in scientific experimentation mean: accuracy (how close results are to the 'true value'),
 precision (how close results are to each other),
 repeatability (how precise different results are when the experiment is conducted again by the same person and setup),
 reproducibility (how precise different results are when the experiment is reproduced by someone else with a different setup), 
and resolution (the smallest change in quantity that you can measure with an instrument).</li>
  <br><li>Random errors are ones that cause inconsistant changes. They affect precision and can be reduced by taking the mean of 3 repeat readings whilst ignoring anomalies. </li>
  <br><li>Systematic errors are ones that cause a consistent changes. They affect accuracy and can be reduced by calibrating instruments with known values.</li>
  <br><li>Uncertainty shows the range of possible values where the true value could lie.</li>
  <br><li>Measurements are results that require taking a difference between two readings- this means that calculating the absolute uncertainty for a 
measurement will be the same as adding the two involved reading uncertainties.</li>

</ul>
